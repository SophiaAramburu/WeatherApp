# Weather App

## Primary Goal
-My primary goal was to create a weather app using OpenWeatherOneCall API. I needed it to show the current temperature, UV index, Humidity level, windspeed, and include a 5 day weather forcast.
## Building a Responsive App
-My first step was to create the framework for the challange, and then linking the JQUERY, Bootstrap, and Javascript to my HTML. My next step was to sign up for OpenWeathermapAPI to generate API keys.
-I then created a fuction weatherHTML to deal with variables such as temperature, UV index, humidity levels, windspeed, ect. 
-I created functions to save the city in localStore [saveCity()], and [loadCity()] to show the historic cities in the HTML. I also created a JQuery listener for the buttons which I created with and attribute call and its value the city stored in localStore.
-Lastly, I went through my code and wrote accessibility comments so the reader and myself can know what the code is doing.
